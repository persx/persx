# Supabase Database Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up Supabase as the database for persx.ai roadmap form submissions.

## Prerequisites

- A Supabase account (sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com))
- The persx.ai codebase with Supabase dependencies installed

## Step 1: Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: persx-ai (or your preferred name)
   - **Database Password**: Choose a secure password (save this!)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users
4. Click "Create new project"
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for the project to be provisioned

## Step 2: Create the Database Table

1. In your Supabase project dashboard, click on the **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql` from this repository
4. Paste it into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" or press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`
6. You should see "Success. No rows returned" message

This creates:
- âœ… `roadmap_submissions` table with all required columns
- âœ… Indexes for performance optimization
- âœ… Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- âœ… Analytics view for reporting

## Step 3: Get Your API Credentials

1. In your Supabase project, click on the **Settings** gear icon (bottom left)
2. Click **API** in the settings menu
3. You'll see two important values:

   **Project URL**
   ```
   https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   ```

   **anon public key** (under "Project API keys")
   ```
   eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```

4. Copy both values - you'll need them in the next step

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

### For Local Development

1. In your project root, copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Open `.env.local` and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```

3. Save the file

### For Vercel Deployment

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
3. Add two new variables:

   | Name | Value |
   |------|-------|
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://your-project-id.supabase.co` |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...` |

4. Make sure to add them for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
5. Click "Save"
6. Redeploy your application

## Step 5: Test the Integration

### Local Testing

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/start
3. Fill out the roadmap form completely
4. Click through all 4 steps
5. Submit the form

### Verify in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Click **Table Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Select the `roadmap_submissions` table
4. You should see your test submission!

### Check the Console

Look for this output in your terminal:
```
=== New Roadmap Submission ===
Timestamp: 2025-10-29T...
Industry: eCommerce
Goal: Improve AOV
Successfully saved to Supabase: [...]
=============================
```

## Step 6: Verify Database Structure

Run this query in the SQL Editor to verify the table:

```sql
SELECT
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'roadmap_submissions'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

Expected columns:
- `id` (uuid)
- `industry` (text)
- `industry_other` (text)
- `goal` (text)
- `martech_stack` (text[])
- `martech_other` (text)
- `additional_details` (text)
- `email` (text)
- `request_full_roadmap` (boolean)
- `created_at` (timestamp with time zone)

## Viewing Your Data

### Table Editor (GUI)

1. Click **Table Editor** in Supabase
2. Select `roadmap_submissions`
3. Browse, filter, and export data

### SQL Editor (Advanced)

Get all submissions from the last 7 days:
```sql
SELECT * FROM roadmap_submissions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

View analytics by industry:
```sql
SELECT
  industry,
  COUNT(*) as total_submissions,
  COUNT(email) as with_email,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN request_full_roadmap THEN 1 END) as full_roadmap_requests
FROM roadmap_submissions
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY total_submissions DESC;
```

## Security & Privacy

### Row Level Security (RLS)

The table has RLS enabled with these policies:

1. **Anonymous inserts**: Anyone can submit the form (required for public form)
2. **Authenticated reads**: Only authenticated users (admins) can view submissions

### Managing Access

To give someone admin access to view submissions:

1. Invite them to your Supabase project
2. They can then view data in the Table Editor or via SQL queries

### Data Export

Export submissions for analysis:

1. Go to **Table Editor** â†’ `roadmap_submissions`
2. Click the three dots menu
3. Select "Download as CSV"

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid API credentials"

**Solution**: Double-check your environment variables
```bash
# Verify they are set
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

### Error: "relation 'roadmap_submissions' does not exist"

**Solution**: The table wasn't created. Run the schema SQL again:
1. Open SQL Editor in Supabase
2. Paste contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Run the query

### Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"

**Solution**: RLS policies might be incorrect. Run this:
```sql
-- Allow inserts for anonymous users
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous inserts"
ON public.roadmap_submissions
FOR INSERT
TO anon, authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);
```

### Data not showing up

**Checklist**:
- âœ… Environment variables are set correctly
- âœ… Table exists in Supabase
- âœ… RLS policies are configured
- âœ… No errors in browser console
- âœ… No errors in terminal/Vercel logs

## Advanced: Setting Up Webhooks

To trigger actions when new submissions arrive:

1. Go to **Database** â†’ **Webhooks** in Supabase
2. Click "Create a new hook"
3. Configure:
   - **Table**: `roadmap_submissions`
   - **Events**: `INSERT`
   - **Type**: HTTP Request
   - **URL**: Your webhook endpoint
4. This can trigger:
   - Email notifications
   - Slack alerts
   - CRM updates
   - Marketing automation

## Next Steps

Now that your database is set up:

1. âœ… Test form submissions
2. âœ… Set up email notifications (SendGrid, etc.)
3. âœ… Create admin dashboard to view submissions
4. âœ… Add analytics tracking
5. âœ… Export data regularly for analysis

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Database**
2. Download a backup manually
3. Set up automated backups to your own storage
